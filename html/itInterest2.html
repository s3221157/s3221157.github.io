My first Job was working as a part time cleaner at a large printing 
factory. On the 3rd level, in the executive area, near a framed 
photograph of Rupert Murdoch hanging on the wall, there was a big, 
locked, glass panelled, air conditioned room containing a series 
of large blue fridge style machines. I watched the workers 
occasionally, it was staffed 24×7, but the staff sat outside the 
room. There was a sticky pad on the floor just outside the doorway. 
No one else, other than the three shift workers were allowed to go 
in the room. As I was polishing the floor outside, I covertly 
checked out the exercise book the staff kept updating  – it seemed 
to be a log of what went on. Sometimes the staff got up from their 
desk, went into the big room, looked at all the machines and 
changed tapes. The staff did not have a monitor at their desk. 
After I garnered the courage to ask what the blue machines did, 
I was surprised to find out it was nothing to do with actual 
printing, but apparently they performed “other important tasks”. 
I had to find out a bit more about this.. </p>

Although I found out later, the role of the computers were “just”
running father &amp; son batch account and ordering updates
throughout the night, I was intrigued by it all. Fast forward a
couple of years, I became a Computer Operator in the public service,
on shift work, looking at blue (sometimes orange which apparently
were a rip off of the blue) machines, changing tapes and printing
great heavy paper stacks every night.</p>

While I did not pursue a specific IT degree, I remained heavily
engaged in all things computers and self taught to program. I am most
interested in Raspberry Pi’s and Arduino’s now, trying to combine
my interest with Amateur Radio. I can communicate around the world I
digital (test) mode without using any other infrastructure other than
my HF radio and a Raspberry Pi.</p>

<u>Why RMIT </u>
</p>
<p style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
It was more the Open University study options that attracted me
rather than RMIT specifically. All the things, for whatever reason I
didn’t do when I was younger, I was now able to study eg chemistry,
maths, programming etc on a piecemeal basis. Why not bundle the
subjects, and try to attain an IT degree, which is where I am now? At
RMIT.</p>

<u>Expectations</u></p>
<p style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
As mentioned, the number one goal is to attain the degree. But having
said that, I’m not sure why it seems important to me.. My career is
unlikely to change. I’m not young, far from it. But having focused
on the technical subjects so far, I think it’s time to go back and
do the degree the way it is meant to be according to it’s
structure, ie filling in 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup>
year requirements, in order. I also feel that since I’m a paying
student through coming through the OUA format, that I’m not taking
up a place a younger person should have as a career launcher.</p>

<p style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
One thing that has changed over the years is a new emphasis on
working in teams, so that will be interesting. This aspect is
emphasised in this Introduction to IT subject, so I’m looking
forward to that while being slightly apprehensive at the same time. 
I’m also looking forward to the non techie material such as ethics
and the social aspects of computing in light of machines become more
and more capable. 26 Billion transistors now on a graphics board –
just can’t get my head around that!Learning about the concepts of
Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning will be timely in view
of the mainstream publicity these aspects are getting and the
workforce is likely to be affected.
