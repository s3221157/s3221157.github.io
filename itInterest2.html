f</span><span style="font-weight: normal">irst Job was working as a
part time cleaner at </span><span style="font-weight: normal">a large
printing factory</span><span style="font-weight: normal">. </span><span style="font-weight: normal">On
the 3</span><sup><span style="font-weight: normal">rd</span></sup><span style="font-weight: normal">
level, in the executive area, near a framed photograph of Rupert
Murdoch hanging on the wall, </span><span style="font-weight: normal">t</span><span style="font-weight: normal">here
was a big, locked, glass panelled, air conditioned room containing a
</span><span style="font-weight: normal">series</span><span style="font-weight: normal">
of </span><span style="font-weight: normal">large</span><span style="font-weight: normal">
blue fridge style machines. I watched the workers occasionally, it
was staffed 24×7, </span><span style="font-weight: normal">but the
staff sat outside the room</span><span style="font-weight: normal">.
</span><span style="font-weight: normal">There was a sticky pad on
the floor just outside the doorway. </span><span style="font-weight: normal">No
one else, </span><span style="font-weight: normal">other than </span><span style="font-weight: normal">the
three shift workers were allowed to go in </span><span style="font-weight: normal">the
room</span><span style="font-weight: normal">. </span><span style="font-weight: normal">As
I was polishing the floor </span><span style="font-weight: normal">outside</span><span style="font-weight: normal">,
I covertly checked out </span><span style="font-weight: normal">the
</span><span style="font-weight: normal">exercise book the </span><span style="font-weight: normal">staff
</span><span style="font-weight: normal">kept </span><span style="font-weight: normal">updating</span><span style="font-weight: normal">
 – it </span><span style="font-weight: normal">seemed to </span><span style="font-weight: normal">be
a </span><span style="font-weight: normal">log of what went on.
Sometime</span><span style="font-weight: normal">s</span><span style="font-weight: normal">
the </span><span style="font-weight: normal">staff </span><span style="font-weight: normal">got
up from their desk, </span><span style="font-weight: normal">went
in</span><span style="font-weight: normal">to</span><span style="font-weight: normal">
the big room, looked at</span><span style="font-weight: normal"> </span><span style="font-weight: normal">all
</span><span style="font-weight: normal">the machines and changed
tapes. The staff did not have </span><span style="font-weight: normal">a
monitor</span><span style="font-weight: normal"> at their desk. </span><span style="font-weight: normal">After
I garnered the courage to ask what the blue machines did, I was
surprised to find out it was nothing to do with actual printing, but
</span><span style="font-weight: normal">apparently </span><span style="font-weight: normal">they
</span><span style="font-weight: normal">performed </span><span style="font-weight: normal">“</span><span style="font-weight: normal">other
important</span><span style="font-weight: normal"> tasks”. I had to
find out a bit more about this.. </span>

Although I found out later, the role of the computers were “just”
running father &amp; son batch account and ordering updates
throughout the night, I was intrigued by it all. Fast forward a
couple of years, I became a Computer Operator in the public service,
on shift work, looking at blue (sometimes orange which apparently
were a rip off of the blue) machines, changing tapes and printing
great heavy paper stacks every night.</p>

While I did not pursue a specific IT degree, I remained heavily
engaged in all things computers and self taught to program. I am most
interested in Raspberry Pi’s and Arduino’s now, trying to combine
my interest with Amateur Radio. I can communicate around the world I
digital (test) mode without using any other infrastructure other than
my HF radio and a Raspberry Pi.</p>

<u>Why RMIT </u>
</p>
<p style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
It was more the Open University study options that attracted me
rather than RMIT specifically. All the things, for whatever reason I
didn’t do when I was younger, I was now able to study eg chemistry,
maths, programming etc on a piecemeal basis. Why not bundle the
subjects, and try to attain an IT degree, which is where I am now? At
RMIT.</p>

<p style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
<u>Expectations</u></p>
<p style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
As mentioned, the number one goal is to attain the degree. But having
said that, I’m not sure why it seems important to me.. My career is
unlikely to change. I’m not young, far from it. But having focused
on the technical subjects so far, I think it’s time to go back and
do the degree the way it is meant to be according to it’s
structure, ie filling in 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup>
year requirements, in order. I also feel that since I’m a paying
student through coming through the OUA format, that I’m not taking
up a place a younger person should have as a career launcher.</p>

<p style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
One thing that has changed over the years is a new emphasis on
working in teams, so that will be interesting. This aspect is
emphasised in this Introduction to IT subject, so I’m looking
forward to that while being slightly apprehensive at the same time. 
I’m also looking forward to the non techie material such as ethics
and the social aspects of computing in light of machines become more
and more capable. 26 Billion transistors now on a graphics board –
just can’t get my head around that!Learning about the concepts of
Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning will be timely in view
of the mainstream publicity these aspects are getting and the
workforce is likely to be affected.
